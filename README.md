### Problem Statement

Keeping track of combat encounters when you're playing Dungeons and Dragons can be tough. You can use paper and pencil, but that can be clunky if you're already using tech for other things. Online tools exist, but sometimes they're just not quite right for your purposes - They keep track of things you're already doing elsewhere, or you wish they had an option to monitor something. Well this tool will solve those problems for good! You'll be able to pick and choose what you want to use the tool to track. Just want something simple to display turn order? No problem! Want something that will log hitpoints, spell slots, legendary actions, and temporary bonuses? You can do that too!
